![https://fuxi.163.com/en/](img/fuxi.png)

This is the original source code of the [ASE 2019 paper (distinguished paper award)](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/details/ase-2019-papers/39/Wuji-Automatic-Online-Combat-Game-Testing-Using-Evolutionary-Deep-Reinforcement-Lear) for game testing,
which combines multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to explore game state and discover bugs.

# How to Use

This code is tested in Ubuntu 18.04.
First the dependent Python libraries should be installed by typing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in a terminal.
Then start a clean (delete all model data via the `-d` argument if you want) experiment by typing `python3 ea.py -d`.
After a while, the number of founded bugs can be seen via TensorBoard (`tensorboard --logdir ~/model/wuji`).
